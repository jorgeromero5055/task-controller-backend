# Task Controller Backend

This is the backend server for the **Task Controller App**, built using **Express.js** and **Apollo Server** to handle GraphQL queries and mutations. It provides all backend functionality for user and task management, integrates with Firebase for authentication, and connects to MongoDB to store data.

## Features

- **Task Management**:

  - Create, edit, delete, get a single task, or fetch all tasks tied to a specific user.
  - Automatically update tasks to mark them as overdue based on their date and completion status before sending them to the frontend.

- **User Management**:

  - Create, update, and delete user accounts.
  - Validate Firebase tokens to authenticate users.
  - Return "not authenticated" if a user hasn't been active for the last 30 days.

- **Database Integration**:

  - Connects to a MongoDB instance for storing tasks and user data.

- **Token Validation**:
  - Uses Firebase Authentication to validate tokens and ensure secure access.

## Live Demo

A hosted version of the app is available at the following link:

Note: The app may take up to 30 seconds to respond to a request if it has been inactive for more than 15 minutes. This delay is due to the backend being hosted on Renderâ€™s free tier, which incurs a server cold start when inactive for more than 15 minutes.
